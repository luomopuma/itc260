<p>I'm a Washington native living in Seattle since 2005. Studied Visual Art at the University of Washington with a minor in Architecture. I spend my time watching weird Horror movies, listening to music/podcasts, and cooking.</p>
<p>Currently, I'm working towards a certificate in Web Development at SCC. This Summer is my 4th quarter. My goals have been to learn more about what the world of Web Dev is about, and what it's opportunities are. Development-wise, I'm a decent programmer with PHP, Python and Java. But I'm interested in improving on those skills while I get better at my workflow and version control practices.</p>
<h3>Availability</h3>
<p>I definitely think I'll be attending online this quarter! And my availability is open during the week if we need to meet for lecture at another time.</p>
